# Radar-System-Project
In this project, we used Atmega16 in addition to an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to 
make a radar prototype. The ultrasonic sensor is attached to a servo motor which rotates 160 
degrees. While the servo is rotating, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of nearby 
objects. The measured distances are to be displayed on a screen. The angle of the object is 
determined as the angle of the servo when the object is detected. The measured distance and 
its corresponding angle, is sent to Processing 3 program on a PC via UART Communication 
Protocol. The information is displayed in a similar manner of the PPI radar screen.
